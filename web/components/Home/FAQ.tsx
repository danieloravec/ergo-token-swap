        <p>
          NFT stands for non-fungible token. It is a unique token that can be
          used to represent ownership of a digital asset. NFTs are stored on the
          blockchain and can be transferred to other users.

        <h2>What is a fungible token?</h2>
        <p>
          Fungible tokens are tokens that can be exchanged for other tokens of
          the same type. For example, if you have 10 USD, you can exchange it
          for 10 EUR. If you have 10 EUR, you can exchange it for 10 USD. This
          means that the value of 10 USD is the same as the value of 10 EUR.
