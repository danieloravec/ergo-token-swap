# Single Tx Swap - report for 10.4.2023 - 16.4.2023

**Author:** Daniel Oravec

## Planned:

- Finalize JWT authentication
- Work on the messaging system, these remain from the previous week:
    - Implement core of the messaging system
    - Design and implement a page for viewing messages
    - Also delete, mark as unread

## Done:

- **[#68]** JWT authentication is ready on BE, but only uses dummy signatures for now,
as `sign_data` endpoint is not yet available in the browser extension wallet.
We need that endpoint for signing secrets for user authentication.
- **[#70]** Add simple messaging system to the backend, only endpoints for
message querying by user and sending messages are implemented. Therefore,
messages can not be deleted nor marked as unread yet.
- **[#71]** Implement sending messages on FE. Also add viewing a list of
messages and opening a message's detail. A reply button is also
available in the detail view (and works). A button for sending a message
is working on each user's profile page.

## Plans for the next week:

- Finalize messaging (deleting messages / possibly marking as unread)
- Add statistics (per-asset volume traded for each user, display this on the
profile page). This was planned to be done before 30.4.2023.
