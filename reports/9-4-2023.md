# Single Tx Swap - report for 3.4.2023 - 9.4.2023

**Author:** Daniel Oravec

## Planned:

- Finalize profile section (add list of assets held by the user, possibly also history of swaps)
- Implement core of the messaging system
- Design and implement a page for viewing messages
- Also delete, mark as unread

## Done:

The work on the profile section lasted longer than expected.

- Finalized profile section **(#67)**
    - View list of NFTs
    - View list of fungible tokens
    - View swap history
        - BE endpoint **(#66)**, Figma design and FE implementation as well
    - Some work on this was done during the previous week
- Incorporating JWT into the auth flow in progress **(#68)**
    - I realized that this is needed for the messaging system to be convenient, so I spent time on this instead of more straightforward parts, such as message inbox page, message sending form etc.


## Plans for the next week:

- Finalize JWT authentication
- Work on the messaging system, these remain from the previous week:
    - Implement core of the messaging system
    - Design and implement a page for viewing messages
    - Also delete, mark as unread
