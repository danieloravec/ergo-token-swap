# Single Tx Swap - report for 24.4.2023 - 30.4.2023

**Author:** Daniel Oravec

## Planned:

- Finalize messaging (deleting messages / possibly marking as unread)
- Add statistics (per-asset volume traded for each user, display this on the
  profile page). This was planned to be done before 30.4.2023.

## Done:

- Deleting messages and marking messages as unread
  - BE endpoint for deleting messages (#82)
  - Extend message model by `senderArchived` and `receiverArchived` fields, so
    that both sides can delete the message on their side only. Add a new endpoint for
    archiving messages. Connect a button to this endpoint on FE (#83)

- Add statistics (volume traded by a user, viewable on their profile section)
  - BE (#79)
  - FE (#80, #81)

- Fix an error where the native token (ERG) was being ignored in
swaps (#85).

- Add a functionality for searching asset holders, so that a user can contact them.
This is a functionality that was planned to be done before May the 2nd in the
specification.
  - BE endpoint (#86)
  - FE page (#87), add error alerts to that page (#88)

## Plans for the next week:

- Add an option to follow a user (marking a user as favourite is an alternative
view). A user will be able to view a list of users they follow in a separate tab
on their profile page for simple access.
