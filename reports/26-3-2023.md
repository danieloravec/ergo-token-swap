# Single Tx Swap - report for 20.3.2023 - 26.3.2023

**Author:** Daniel Oravec

## Planned:
Nothing

## Done:
- Created `users` table
- Refactored BE so that the API is split into multiple files
- Minor FE design fixes, such as alignment, margins, ...
- BE for profiles is mostly ready (no stats, those are a different feature)
    - Endpoint for creating / updating a user
    - Endpoint for getting basic user data
        - Contact info, address
    - Endpoint for getting user's assets
        - Assets are split into NFTs and fungible tokens
- WIP: Profile FE
    - Heading for the profile page is almost ready on FE
        - Contact info, address, a dummy image
        - Tabs for NFTs and Fungible tokens, with no data yet.
            - Displaying these assets is WIP
            - Data can already be fetched from BE
    - _Edit profile_ page is ready, but no authentication yet (so it is unusable right now)
        - The user can change their contact info there
        - For authentication (needed to update profile information), we need a `sign_data` endpoint supported by the browser extension wallet, which is not yet available. A standard is proposed by someone and being discussed right now, but no ETA on the availability of this feature. Therefore, we just use dummy signatures and pretend that bad actors do not exist for now (anyone can fake signatures now).
    - Once the a profile on `/profile/{address}` is visited for the first time on FE, a user with this `address` is created. Therefore, anyone can create any users, which is a feature and not an issue.
        - Will need to think about whether this allows for some attack where a bad actor creates many profiles. A fix would be to only allow profile creation if that address made at least one transaction on the blockchain in the past.

All work is in PRs `#61`, `#62`, `#63` and `fe/profile` branch (which is still WIP, most of the work for this week is there).

## Plans for the next week:
Will probably not have time to do anything, but in case I'll
find some, I'd like to finalize profiles:
- Display NFTs and fungible tokens held by the user on their profile page
